    # W + 0.9W + 0.9W = 1920
    #
    # 2.8W = 1920

    #
    # H + 0.9H + 0.9H = 1080

    # H = 1080 / 2.8

    #
    # horizontal overlap:
    # 686 × 0.10 ≈ 69 pixels
    #
    # tile_height ≈ 386 pixels
    # overlap = 0.10 (10%)

    #        ≈ 617 pixels

    # T2 starts at x ≈ 617
    # T3 starts at x ≈ 1234
